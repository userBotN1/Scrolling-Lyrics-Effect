[00:16.07]Tell me somethin' girl
[00:21.30]Are you happy in this modern world?
[00:25.75]Or do you need more?
[00:30.80]Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
[00:35.25]I'm falling
[00:41.25]In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
[00:50.80]And in the bad times I fear myself
[01:05.77]Tell me something boy
[01:10.25]Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
[01:15.49]Or do you need more?
[01:20.26]Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?
[01:25.00]I'm falling
[01:30.50]In all the good times I find myself longing for change
[01:40.00]And in the bad times I fear myself
[01:45.00]I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
[01:49.76]I'll never meet the ground
[01:55.00]Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
[01:59.75]We're far from the shallow now
[02:05.76]In the shallow, shallow
[02:10.25]In the shallow, shallow
[02:15.25]In the shallow, shallow
[02:20.00]We're far from the shallow now
[02:27.75]Wooaaaah
[02:34.00]Woaaaaaaaaaaah
[02:45.00]I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
[02:49.76]I'll never meet the ground
[02:54.75]Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
[02:59.52]We're far from the shallow now
[03:05.25]In the shallow, shallow
[03:10.25]In the shallow, shallow
[03:15.25]In the shallow, shallow
[03:19.75]We're far from the shallow now
[03:26.75]`;
